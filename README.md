# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Synthetic Medical Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing performed on a synthetic medical dataset (`death_prediction_synthetic`).  
The goal of the analysis is to identify factors associated with 5-year mortality and to prepare a clean, well-structured dataset for further modeling.

## Dataset
- Number of observations: 12,439  
- Number of features: 45  
  - 26 numerical variables  
  - 19 categorical variables  
- Target variable: `dead_5y` (mortality after 5 years)

## Analysis Workflow
The project is structured as follows:

1. **Initial Data Exploration**
   - Dataset overview and variable description
   - Detection of missing values and outliers
   - Distribution analysis for numerical and categorical variables

2. **Relationship Analysis**
   - Pearson correlation for numerical variables
   - Chi-square tests for categorical variables
   - ANOVA for categorical vs. numerical variables
   - Identification of highly correlated features (correlation > 0.7)

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Outlier impact assessment using correlation and distribution tests
   - Missing value handling based on missingness percentage and pattern (MCAR / MAR)
   - Feature removal based on redundancy and statistical criteria

4. **Feature Selection & Engineering**
   - Removal of redundant variables
   - Creation of additional derived features
   - Preparation of a cleaned dataset for modeling

5. **Conclusions**
   - Identification of key predictors associated with mortality
   - Summary of clinically and analytically relevant findings

A detailed written report is provided in `EDA1.pdf`.
